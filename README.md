Student's Friend
==============

## About
Student's Friend is an online course management system built by a team of myself and 3 others for our senior project at Penn State Behrend.

The system allows users and faculty to log in and view announcements, assignments, their course schedule, and upload/download files. It also features a flash card system for studying and a forum for communication amongst other students and faculty.
